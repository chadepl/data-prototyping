# Data Prototyping

Data is all around us. Data doesn't have to be big, nor does it have to come in a pre-specified format.
Since the invention of writing and drawing, many technological advances have emerged to help us make sense of data and communicate our findings to others.
This repository contains various experiments in exploring datasets using modern technologies such as web applications and AI.

It's easy to fall into the trap of striving for completenessâ€”yet nothing is ever truly complete, and datasets are no exception.
Therefore, in this repo, I prioritize shipping fast prototypes based on pre-defined datasets, however small they might be.
If the data changesâ€”whether a richer dataset becomes available, I discover two datasets can be merged, or new ideas ariseâ€”I will develop a new prototype instead of getting stuck refining an existing one.
Thatâ€™s the intention, anyway. Let's see what reality brings.

## Repo Setup

* `datasets`: Contains datasets Iâ€™ve gathered. If a dataset is too large to include in the repo, Iâ€™ll provide pointers to where it can be found.
* `prototypes`: Prototypes Iâ€™ve developed so far. Exploratory data analyses (EDA) and quick explorations to develop intuition about a dataset also count as separate projects and prepended with "eda".

## Prototypes

| Project Name | Description | Datasets | Status |
